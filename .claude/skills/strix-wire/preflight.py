"""strix-wire preflight guard — fail-closed detection of repos that must NOT be
auto-wired.

strix-wire is a *quickstart* for codebases with NO governance: it wraps ONE
irreversible call and RUNS it once. Two kinds of repo make that a mistake, and
this guard exists so the skill refuses by construction instead of relying on a
human noticing:

  1. ALREADY-GOVERNED — the repo already ships a first-party Strix governance
     layer (governedProcedure / Canonical Proof Flow / signed evidence). Wiring
     the quickstart helper here adds a lesser, unsigned, redundant path.

  2. PRODUCTION — the repo shows live-system markers (live Stripe keys,
     .env.production, real deploy domains). strix-wire's final step fires a real
     irreversible mutation; that must never happen on a live system without
     explicit sign-off.

Contract (pinned by tests/test_strix_wire_preflight.py):
  - stdlib only, standalone (no solo_builder import) so it is byte-identical as
    the loose skill file AND vendored into the strix-personal plugin.
  - verdict "STOP" when governed OR production markers are found; "OK" otherwise.
  - exit code 3 on STOP, 0 on OK, 2 on bad invocation. Fail CLOSED: an
    unreadable root or a scan error resolves to STOP, never a silent OK.
